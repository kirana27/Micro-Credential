  <p><b>Personal Review</b><br><br> This movie is perfect to watch with the family. My favorite part of the movie was when Ishaan's
  teacher noticed that he loved to paint, and he was creative. The teacher hosted a school paiting competition dedicated to
  Ishaan. The competition was substituted for regular  school hours. Once all the students submitted their art, there were four
  judges who had to pick the top paintings. After, the judges made their final decisions and Ishaan came in first place. Ishaan
  was so happy, he had never came in first place before. This was an unforgettable experince for Ishaan. Finally, at the end
  Ishaan saw his parents again. </p>
