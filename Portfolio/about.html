      <h1>About Me!</h1>
      <p>Hey there, my name is Kirana Ali. I am a resident of New York City. I attend John Jay College of Criminal Justice, majoring in Computer Science
        and Information Security. I am currently pursuing a career in Front-End-Development. My interest in computer science grew after participating in
        a one-week program called Summer Guild, where I was introduced to the fundamentals of web development. I was successful in creating my own website
        dedicated to poverty. I've been working on personal projects since then.</p>
        <img src="" alt=""> <br><br>Spending quality time with my family is something I like doing.
        I feel at ease and genuine joy when I'm around my family. I relax and let go of everything. My family and I go on trips together, have sleepovers,
        watch movies together, have barbeques at my uncle's place, and celebrate birthdays and holidays together. We are all intertwined. We Face Time each
        other when we aren't together.<br><br>Photography, reading, and baking are some of my favorite hobbies</p>
